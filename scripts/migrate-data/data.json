            "long-desc": "A 2048 AI agent trained with Q-learning and reinforcement learning algorithms to explore possible random moves in the game. The algorithms enable the agent to identify high-reward moves, thus improving performance through exploitation. The game is built with Tkinter, and is then controlled by the 2048AIAgent through array selection. To train the agent to make predictions for the next best move, each game calculates a Q-value determined by its actions, reward received, game state, and a previous Q-value if any. An epsilon value controls the randomness of the agent's actions; after a certain number of games, this value hits below zero, thus allowing the agent to shift to exploitation, making non-random predictions for the highest reward-yielding moves.",

This program allows users to select one of many different stocks from a dropdown menu and specify a start date and an end date to define the date range for the stock data they wish to view. It then generates a plot of the selected stock's average price over the specified date range. The graph displays the average stock prices on the y-axis and dates on the x-axis. Below the graph, the application pulls up three news articles related to the selected stock within the specified date range, displaying clickable headlines. The user interface is built using React.js, the back-end logic is implemented with Python and Flask, and the graph is created using Pandas and Plotly. The news articles are fetched using the World News API.",

            "long-desc": "Don't Be Alarmed is an Android alarm app that incorporates activities to ensure the user is fully awake before turning off the alarm to prevent the user from falling back asleep. Currently, the app offers basic alarm functionality and the option of a math game activity. Once the alarm sounds, the user must solve five math problems correctly to complete the activity and shut it off. The initial prototype was developed in Figma to provide an intuitive and visually pleasing user interface. It was then built in Android Studio using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to display the designed layout for the frontend and supported by JSON Object to store a database of alarm information for the backend. These tools enable the app to showcase pages featuring alarm lists, customization settings, and activities. Once the userâ€™s scheduled time arrives, it triggers a pre-selected alarm sound and activity.",
