## FAQ
1. What's a template?
> A document that has the questions, choices for the question if applicable, and deadline. The document can not be modified as there are no endpoints to allow someone to do this. This was created so that every person filling out the application for a given cohort will have the same questions, which keeps it fair and the documents consistent with each other.
2. What's a draft?
> A document that has the questions, choices for the question if applicable, and deadline. You are able to alter the questions and deadline. This was created to allow cabinet members to brainstorm and figure out what the application will look like for the cohort. Once a draft is published, it will create a template document which can't be altered (through endpoints).
